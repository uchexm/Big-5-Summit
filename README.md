<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About This Project

- [./images/readme.PNG](https://uchexm.github.io/Big-5-Summit/index.html)

The focus of Big 5 Wildlife Conservation project is to assist with the operation and rehabilitation of two of Africa’s National Parks – its largest, Serengeti, and one of its most neglected, the Zambezi National Park. The project supplies game water for wildlife, particularly to support Hwange’s ever-growing elephant population. It also assists National Parks rangers with park maintenance, deployment of personnel and environmental monitoring

Here's why:
* This is a unique opportunity to use tech to enhance the job of the Field Assistants, supporting the daily operations of the project staff. Monitor park infrastructure and development projects, wildlife monitoring, bird and animal population surveys, and ranger field support.
* Learn about the work being done to sustain Africa’s wildlife and natural environment, and the challenges facing conservationists working to support animals in vast National Parks.
* The Big 5 Conservation volunteer program has been established for as long as the Trust have been operating. It allows wildlife enthusiasts to join the team, and enjoy a rare and exciting opportunity to experience the Africa of conservationists, and its vast, remote wilderness areas.

The Big 5 Conservation Programme works around the full moon, as this and the period just after, is when animals like lions tend to be most active. 

Our activities and program will depend on the time of year we meet and implement our findings to join the project, but there is plenty to do year-round and your work will always be useful, exciting and interesting.
